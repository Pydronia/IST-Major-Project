## Problem analysis

Mobile gaming is boring. No matter how far you flap your bird or how many flowers you plant in your
virtual town, eventually you always find yourself bored. This happens because tapping towards a higher score,
more coins or a larger village is not having fun. It's grinding because you have nothing else to do.
It's more a form of distraction than entertainment.

This happens because current mobile gaming takes place by yourself on a five inch screen, with your fingers
as the controllers.

We think that we can offer a solution, thanks to ARKit. With ARKit we can take the game off
the five inch screen and out into the world. Previous attempts to do this, such as ---Examples could go here---, have been wildly successful.

Gaming on mobile with ARKit is better because it creates a more social, engaging and tangible experience.

The social aspect of gaming, one which is often neglected, is perhaps one of it's most important. Humans are social creatures, and engaging with others makes almost any activity feel better. This means that for a person to really enjoy a game, rather than just be distracted by it, they should play that game with others.

Another thing a game must to for it to be enjoyable is engage it's audience. Frequently this is mistaken for absorbing it's users, blocking them from the outside world. I would argue that the opposite is more true. The best way for a game to engage it's user is to engage in it's user's reality.

For a game to feel worthwhile, rather than just a waste of time, it must create a tangible result for the player. Mobile gaming struggles to do this because all the results are contained within a five inch screen. By taking the results off that screen and out into the world. ARKit allows us to provide a far more real result.
